        <p>
            Web development refers to the process of building and maintaining websites and web applications.
            <br>It involves a range of tasks including web design, web programming, server-side scripting, client-side scripting, and database management.
            <br> Web developers use various programming languages and frameworks such as HTML, CSS, JavaScript, PHP, Python, Ruby on Rails, and others to create dynamic and interactive websites.
<br>

<br>
Web development can be divided into two main categories:
<br>
<br>

1. Front-end development: This involves creating the visible parts of a website that users interact with directly.
<br> Front-end developers focus on the layout, design, and interactivity of web pages using languages like HTML, CSS, and JavaScript.
 They ensure that the website is visually appealing, <br> responsive, and user-friendly.
<br>
<br>

2. Back-end development: This involves building and maintaining the server-side of a website, which includes managing databases, handling user authentication, processing data, and server configuration.
<br> Back-end developers work with programming languages like PHP, Python, Ruby, Java, and frameworks like Node.js to create the logic and functionality behind the scenes that power the website.
        </br>

Overall, web development encompasses the entire process of creating a website or web application, from planning and design to coding and deployment, with the goal of delivering a seamless <br> and engaging user experience.
